            <h2>Addiction</h2> 
            <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addiction" alt="Link to Wikipedia about Addiction" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/addict.jpg" alt="Picture of an Addict"></a>
                <p>Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli despite adverse consequences. 
                    Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, 
                    a biological process—one that is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus—is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction, 
                    according to the "brain disease model" of addiction. 
                    However, many scholars who study addiction argue that the brain disease model is incomplete and misleading. 
                    Addiction is a disorder of the brain's reward system which arises through transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms and develops over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus 
                    (e.g., eating food, the use of cocaine, engagement in sexual activity, participation in high-thrill cultural activities such as gambling, etc.). 
                    DeltaFosB (ΔFosB), a gene transcription factor, is a critical component and common factor in the development of virtually all forms of behavioral and drug addictions. 
                    Two decades of research into ΔFosB's role in addiction have demonstrated that addiction arises, and the associated compulsive behavior intensifies or attenuates, along with the overexpression of ΔFosB in the D1-type medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens. 
                    Due to the causal relationship between ΔFosB expression and addictions, it is used preclinically as an addiction biomarker.
                    ΔFosB expression in these neurons directly and positively regulates drug self-administration and reward sensitization through positive reinforcement, while decreasing sensitivity to aversion. 
                    Addiction exacts an "astoundingly high financial and human toll" on individuals and society as a whole. 
                    In the United States, the total economic cost to society is greater than that of all types of diabetes and all cancers combined. 
                    These costs arise from the direct adverse effects of drugs and associated healthcare costs (e.g., emergency medical services and outpatient and inpatient care), long-term complications (e.g., lung cancer from smoking tobacco products, 
                    liver cirrhosis and dementia from chronic alcohol consumption, and meth mouth from methamphetamine use), the loss of productivity and associated welfare costs, fatal and non-fatal accidents (e.g., traffic collisions), 
                    suicides, homicides, and incarceration, among others.

                <h2>Gambling Addiction</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_gambling" alt="Link to Gambling Problems" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/gambling.jpg" alt="Gambling addict picture"></a>
                
                    <h3>Problem gambling</h3>
                    <p>- is an urge to gamble continuously despite negative consequences or a desire to stop. 
                    Problem gambling is often defined by whether harm is experienced by the gambler or others, rather than by the gambler's behaviour. 
                    Severe problem gambling may be diagnosed as clinical pathological gambling if the gambler meets certain criteria. Pathological gambling is a common disorder that is associated with both social and family costs.
                    The DSM-5 has re-classified the condition as an addictive disorder, with sufferers exhibiting many similarities to those who have substance addictions. The term gambling addiction has long been used in the recovery movement. 
                    Pathological gambling was long considered by the American Psychiatric Association to be an impulse control disorder rather than an addiction. However, 
                    data suggest a closer relationship between pathological gambling and substance use disorders than exists between PG and obsessive-compulsive disorder, largely because the behaviors in problem gambling and most primary substance use disorders 
                    (i.e. those not resulting from a desire to "self-medicate" for another condition such as depression) seek to activate the brain's reward mechanisms while the behaviors characterizing obsessive-compulsive disorder are prompted by overactive and misplaced signals from the brain's fear mechanisms. 
                    Problem gambling is an addictive behavior with a high comorbidity with alcohol problems. A common feature shared by people who suffer from gambling addiction is impulsivity.

                    <h3>History</h3>
                <p> 
                    Gambling dates back to the Paleolithic period, before written history. In Mesopotamia the earliest six-sided dice date to about 3000 BC. 
                    However, they were based on astragali dating back thousands of years earlier. In China, gambling houses were widespread in the first millennium BC, and betting on fighting animals was common. 
                    Lotto games and dominoes (precursors of Pai Gow) appeared in China as early as the 10th century. 
                    Playing cards appeared in the 9th century AD in China. Records trace gambling in Japan back at least as far as the 14th century.               
                    Poker, the most popular U.S. card game associated with gambling, derives from the Persian game As-Nas, dating back to the 17th century.                
                    The first known casino, the Ridotto, started operating in 1638 in Venice, Italy.
                    <br><strong>Great Britain</strong><br>
                    Gambling has been a main recreational activity in Great Britain for centuries. Horseracing has been a favorite theme for over three centuries. 
                    It has been heavily regulated. Historically much of the opposition comes from evangelical Protestants, and from social reformers.
                    <br><strong>United States</strong><br>
                    Gambling has been a popular activity in the United States for centuries. It has also been suppressed by law in many areas for almost as long. 
                    By the early 20th century, gambling was almost uniformly outlawed throughout the U.S. and thus became a largely illegal activity, helping to spur the growth of the mafia and other criminal organizations. 
                    The late 20th century saw a softening in attitudes towards gambling and a relaxation of laws against it.
                </p>
                    <h3>Religious views</h3>
                <p>
                    <br><strong>Hinduism</strong><br>
                    Ancient Hindu poems like the Gambler's Lament and the Mahabharata testify to the popularity of gambling among ancient Indians. 
                    However, the text Arthashastra (c. 4th century BC) recommends taxation and control of gambling.
                    <br><br><strong>Judaism</strong><br>
                    Ancient Jewish authorities frowned on gambling, even disqualifying professional gamblers from testifying in court.
                    <br><br><strong>Christianity</strong>
                    <br><br>The <strong>Catholic</strong> Church holds the position that there is no moral impediment to gambling, so long as it is fair, all bettors have a reasonable chance of winning, there is no fraud involved, and the parties involved do not have actual knowledge of the outcome of the bet (unless they have disclosed this knowledge), and as long as the following conditions are met: 
                    the gambler can afford to lose the bet, and stops when the limit is reached, and the motivation is entertainment and not personal gain leading to the "love of money" or making a living. 
                    In general, Catholic bishops have opposed casino gambling on the grounds that it too often tempts people into problem gambling or addiction, and has particularly negative effects on poor people; they sometimes also cite secondary effects such as increases in loan sharking, prostitution, corruption, and general public immorality. 
                    Some parish pastors have also opposed casinos for the additional reason that they would take customers away from church bingo and annual festivals where games such as blackjack, roulette, craps, and poker are used for fundraising. 
                    St. Thomas Aquinas wrote that gambling should be especially forbidden where the losing bettor is underage or otherwise not able to consent to the transaction. 
                    Gambling has often been seen as having social consequences, as satirized by Balzac. 
                    For these social and religious reasons, most legal jurisdictions limit gambling, as advocated by Pascal.
                    <br><br>Gambling views among <strong>Protestants</strong> vary, with some either discouraging or forbidding their members from participation in gambling. 
                    Methodists, in accordance with the doctrine of outward holiness, oppose gambling which they believe is a sin that feeds on greed; 
                    examples are the United Methodist Church, the Free Methodist Church, the Evangelical Wesleyan Church, the Salvation Army, and the Church of the Nazarene.
                    <br>Other Protestants that oppose gambling include many Mennonites, Quakers, the Christian Reformed Church in North America, the Church of the Lutheran Confession, the Southern Baptist Convention, the Assemblies of God, and the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
                    <br><br><strong>Other Christian denominations</strong><br>
                    Other churches that oppose gambling include the Jehovah's Witnesses, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[44] the Iglesia Ni Cristo,[45] and the Members Church of God International.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Islam</strong><br>
                    Although different interpretations of Shari‘ah (Islamic Law) exist in the Muslim world, there is a consensus among the ‘Ulema’ (Arabic: عُـلـمـاء‎, Scholars (of Islam)) that gambling is haraam (Arabic: حَـرام‎, sinful or forbidden). In assertions made during its prohibition, Muslim jurists describe gambling as being both un-Qur’anic, 
                    and as being generally harmful to the Muslim Ummah (Arabic: أُمَّـة‎, Community). The Arabic terminology for gambling is Maisir.
                    <br>
                    They ask you about intoxicants and gambling. Say: 'In them both lies grave sin, though some benefit, to mankind. But their sin is more grave than their benefit.'<br>
                    <strong>— Qur'an, 2:219 (al-Baqara)</strong>
                    In parts of the world that implement full Shari‘ah, such as Aceh, punishments for Muslim gamblers can range up to 12 lashes or a one-year prison term and a fine for those who provide a venue for such practises.[48] Some Islamic nations prohibit gambling; most other countries regulate it.[49]

                <h3>Other non-casino gambling games include:</h3>
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card games, such as Liar's poker, Bridge, Basset, Lansquenet, Piquet, Put, Teen patti</li>
                    <li>Carnival Games such as The Razzle or Hanky Pank</li>
                    <li>Coin-tossing games such as Head and Tail, Two-up*</li>
                    <li>Confidence tricks such as Three-card Monte or the Shell game</li>
                    <li>Dice-based games, such as Backgammon, Liar's dice, Passe-dix, Hazard, Threes, Pig, or Mexico (or Perudo);
                        *Although coin tossing is not usually played in a casino, it has been known to be an official gambling game in some Australian casinos.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                <br><br><strong>Fixed-odds betting</strong>
                Fixed-odds betting and Parimutuel betting frequently occur at many types of sporting events, and political elections. 
                In addition many bookmakers offer fixed odds on a number of non-sports related outcomes, for example the direction and extent of movement of various financial indices, the winner of television competitions such as Big Brother, and election results. 
                Interactive prediction markets also offer trading on these outcomes, with "shares" of results trading on an open market.
                <br><br><strong>Parimutuel betting</strong>
                One of the most widespread forms of gambling involves betting on horse or greyhound racing. Wagering may take place through parimutuel pools, or bookmakers may take bets personally. Parimutuel wagers pay off at prices determined by support in the wagering pools, 
                while bookmakers pay off either at the odds offered at the time of accepting the bet; or at the median odds offered by track bookmakers at the time the race started.
                <br><br><strong>Sports betting</strong>
                Betting on team sports has become an important service industry in many countries. For example, millions of people play the football pools every week in the United Kingdom. In addition to organized sports betting, both legal and illegal, there are many side-betting games played by casual groups of spectators, such as NCAA Basketball Tournament Bracket Pools, Super Bowl Squares, 
                Fantasy Sports Leagues with monetary entry fees and winnings, and in-person spectator games like Moundball.
                <br><br><strong>Virtual sports</strong><br>
                Based on Sports Betting, Virtual Sports are fantasy and never played sports events made by software that can be played every time without wondering about external things like weather conditions.
                <br><br><strong>Arbitrage betting</strong><br>
                Arbitrage betting is a theoretically risk-free betting system in which every outcome of an event is bet upon so that a known profit will be made by the bettor upon completion of the event, regardless of the outcome. Arbitrage betting is a combination of the ancient art of arbitrage trading and gambling, 
                which has been made possible by the large numbers of bookmakers in the marketplace, creating occasional opportunities for arbitrage.
                <br><br><strong>Other types of betting</strong><br>
                One can also bet with another person that a statement is true or false, or that a specified event will happen (a "back bet") or will not happen (a "lay bet") within a specified time. This occurs in particular when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events. 
                Not only do the parties hope to gain from the bet, they place the bet also to demonstrate their certainty about the issue. 
                Some means of determining the issue at stake must exist. Sometimes the amount bet remains nominal, demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial importance.
                Betting exchanges allow consumers to both back and lay at odds of their choice. Similar in some ways to a stock exchange, a bettor may want to back a horse (hoping it will win) or lay a horse (hoping it will lose, effectively acting as bookmaker).
                Spread betting allows gamblers to wagering on the outcome of an event where the pay-off is based on the accuracy of the wager, rather than a simple "win or lose" outcome. For example, a wager can be based on the when a point is scored in the game in minutes and each minute away from the prediction increases or reduces the payout.
                <br><br><strong>Staking systems</strong><br>
                Betting systems have been created in an attempt to "beat the house" but no system can make a mathematically unprofitable bet in terms of expected value profitable over time. 
                </p>
                <h3>Widely used systems include:</h3>
                <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Card counting – Many systems exist for Blackjack to keep track of the ratio of ten values to all others; when this ratio is high the player has an advantage and should increase the amount of their bets. Keeping track of cards dealt confers an advantage in other games as well.</li>
                    <li>Due-column betting – A variation on fixed profits betting in which the bettor sets a target profit and then calculates a bet size that will make this profit, adding any losses to the target.</li>
                    <li>Fixed profits – the stakes vary based on the odds to ensure the same profit from each winning selection.</li>
                    <li>Fixed stakes – a traditional system of staking the same amount on each selection.</li>
                    <li>Kelly – the optimum level to bet to maximize your future median bank level.</li>
                    <li>Martingale – A system based on staking enough each time to recover losses from previous bet(s) until one wins.</li>
                </ul>

                Gloria Mundi, or The Devil addressing the sun, a cartoon showing the British politician Charles James Fox standing on a roulette wheel perched atop a globe showing England and continental Europe. The implication is that his penniless state, indicated by turned-out pockets, is due to gambling.
                Many risk-return choices are sometimes referred to colloquially as "gambling." Whether this terminology is acceptable is a matter of debate:
                Emotional or physical risk-taking, where the risk-return ratio is not quantifiable (e.g., skydiving, campaigning for political office, asking someone for a date, etc.)
                Insurance is a method of shifting risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, which is similar to calculating gambling odds. Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make. 
                While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an insurable interest, 
                the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).
                Situations where the possible return is of secondary importance to the wager/purchase (e.g. entering a raffle in support of a charitable cause)
                Investments are also usually not considered gambling, although some investments can involve significant risk. Examples of investments include stocks, bonds and real estate. Starting a business can also be considered a form of investment. Investments are generally not considered gambling when they meet the following criteria:
                <br><br>
                <strong>Economic utility</strong><br>
                Positive expected returns (at least in the long term)<br>
                Underlying value independent of the risk being undertaken
                <br>
                Some speculative investment activities are particularly risky, but are sometimes perceived to be different from gambling:
                <br><strong>Foreign currency exchange (forex) transactions</strong><br>
                Securities derivatives, such as options or futures, where the value of the derivative is dependent on the value of the underlying asset at a specific point in time (typically the derivative's associated expiration date)
                <br><br><strong> Negative consequences</strong><br>
                Studies show that though many people participate in gambling as a form of recreation or even as a means to gain an income, gambling, like any behavior that involves variation in brain chemistry, can become a harmful, behavioral addiction. 
                Behavioral addiction can occur with all the negative consequences in a person's life minus the physical issues faced by people who compulsively engage in drug and alcohol abuse. 
                Reinforcement schedules may also make gamblers persist in gambling even after repeated losses. 
                This is where the organized crime often ends up making large profits, allowing gamblers lines of credit and charge high percentage rates known as vigs to be paid weekly, with crime family enforcement.
                The Russian writer and problem gambler Fyodor Dostoevsky portrays in his novella The Gambler the psychological implications of gambling and how gambling can affect gamblers. He also associates gambling and the idea of "getting rich quick", suggesting that Russians may have a particular affinity for gambling. 
                Dostoevsky shows the effect of betting money for the chance of gaining more in 19th-century Europe. The association between Russians and gambling has fed legends of the origins of Russian roulette. 
                There are many symptoms and reasons for gambling. Gamblers gamble more money to try to win back money that they have lost and some gamble to relieve feelings of helplessness and anxiety.
                In the United Kingdom, the Advertising Standards Authority has censured several betting firms for advertisements disguised as news articles suggesting falsely a person had cleared debts and paid for medical expenses by online gambling. The firms face possible fines.

                <h2>Drugs</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugs" alt="Link to Wikipedia" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/drugs.jpg" alt="Drugs picture"></a>
                <p> A drug is any substance that causes a change in an organism's physiology or psychology when consumed. 
                    Drugs are typically distinguished from food and substances that provide nutritional support. 
                    Consumption of drugs can be via inhalation, injection, smoking, ingestion, absorption via a patch on the skin, or dissolution under the tongue. 
                    In pharmacology, a drug is a chemical substance, typically of known structure, which, when administered to a living organism, produces a biological effect. 
                    A pharmaceutical drug, also called a medication or medicine, is a chemical substance used to treat, cure, prevent, or diagnose a disease or to promote well-being. 
                    Traditionally drugs were obtained through extraction from medicinal plants, but more recently also by organic synthesis. 
                    Pharmaceutical drugs may be used for a limited duration, or on a regular basis for chronic disorders. 
                    Pharmaceutical drugs are often classified into drug classes—groups of related drugs that have similar chemical structures, the same mechanism of action (binding to the same biological target), 
                    a related mode of action, and that are used to treat the same disease. 
                    The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC), the most widely used drug classification system, assigns drugs a unique ATC code, 
                    which is an alphanumeric code that assigns it to specific drug classes within the ATC system. Another major classification system is the Biopharmaceutics Classification System. 
                    This classifies drugs according to their solubility and permeability or absorption properties. 
                    Psychoactive drugs are chemical substances that affect the function of the central nervous system, altering perception, mood or consciousness. 
                    These drugs are divided into different groups like: stimulants, depressants, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antipsychotics, and hallucinogens. 
                    These psychoactive drugs have been proven useful in treating wide range of medical conditions including mental disorders around the world. The most widely used drugs in the world include caffeine, 
                    nicotine and alcohol, which are also considered recreational drugs, since they are used for pleasure rather than medicinal purposes. 
                    Abuse of several psychoactive drugs can cause psychological or physical addiction. 
                    It's worth noting that all drugs can have potential side effects. 
                    Excessive use of stimulants can promote stimulant psychosis. 
                    Many recreational drugs are illicit and international treaties such as the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs exist for the purpose of their prohibition.</p>

                <p>
                <strong>Alcohol and Alcoholism</strong> is a bimonthly peer-reviewed medical journal covering alcoholism and other health effects of alcohol. 
                    It was established in 1963 as the Bulletin on Alcoholism, with H.D. Chalke as the founding editor. 
                    In 1968, it was renamed the Journal of Alcoholism, and in 1977, it was again renamed, this time to British Journal on Alcohol and Alcoholism. 
                    In 1983, it obtained its current name. 
                    It is co-owned and co-published by the Medical Council on Alcohol (MCA) along with Oxford University Press, which bought a 50% stake in the journal in 2011. 
                    It is the official journal of both the MCA and the European Society for Biomedical Research on Alcoholism. 
                    The editors-in-chief are Jonathan D. Chick (Castle Craig Hospital), Philippe de Witte (Université Catholique de Louvain), and Lorenzo Leggio (Bethesda, MD, USA). 
                    According to the Journal Citation Reports, the journal has a 2015 impact factor of 2.724, ranking it 7th out of 18 journals in the category "Substance Abuse".

                <h2>Cocaine</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocaine" alt="Link to Wikipedia" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/cocaine.jpg" alt="Cocaine picture"></a>
                <p> 
                <strong>Cocaine</strong>, also known as coke or blow, is a strong stimulant most frequently used as a recreational drug. 
                    It is commonly snorted, inhaled as smoke, or dissolved and injected into a vein. 
                    Mental effects may include an intense feeling of happiness, loss of contact with reality, or agitation. 
                    Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. 
                    High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. 
                    Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery. 
                    Cocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. 
                    Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. 
                    Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar, which can result in additional toxicity. 
                    Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired. 
                    Cocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. 
                    This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. 
                    It can easily cross the blood–brain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. 
                    It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to US$500 billion each year. With further processing, crack cocaine can be produced from cocaine. 
                    Cocaine is the second most frequently used illegal drug globally, after cannabis. Between 14 and 21 million people use the drug each year. 
                    Use is highest in North America followed by Europe and South America. 
                    Between one and three percent of people in the developed world have used cocaine at some point in their life. 
                    In 2013, cocaine use directly resulted in 4,300 deaths, up from 2,400 in 1990. 
                    It is named after the coca plant from which it is isolated. The plant's leaves have been used by Peruvians since ancient times. 
                    Cocaine was first isolated from the leaves in 1860. Since 1961, the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs has required countries to make recreational use of cocaine a crime.

                <h2>Amphetamine</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine" alt="Link to Wikipedia" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/speed.jpg" alt="Amphetamine picture"></a>
                <p> 
                <strong>Amphetamine</strong> a.k.a. Speed (contracted from alpha-methylphenethylamine) is a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant marketed under the brand name Evekeo, among others. 
                    It is used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), narcolepsy, and obesity. 
                    Amphetamine was discovered in 1887 and exists as two enantiomers: levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine. 
                    Amphetamine properly refers to a specific chemical, the racemic free base, which is equal parts of the two enantiomers, levoamphetamine and dextroamphetamine, in their pure amine forms. 
                    The term is frequently used informally to refer to any combination of the enantiomers, or to either of them alone. Historically, it has been used to treat nasal congestion and depression. 
                    Amphetamine is also used as an athletic performance enhancer and cognitive enhancer, and recreationally as an aphrodisiac and euphoriant. 
                    It is a prescription drug in many countries, and unauthorized possession and distribution of amphetamine are often tightly controlled due to the significant health risks associated with recreational use. 
                    The first amphetamine pharmaceutical was Benzedrine, a brand which was used to treat a variety of conditions. 
                    Currently, pharmaceutical amphetamine is prescribed as racemic amphetamine, Adderall, dextroamphetamine, or the inactive prodrug lisdexamfetamine. 
                    Amphetamine increases monoamine and excitatory neurotransmission in the brain, with its most pronounced effects targeting the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitter systems. 
                    At therapeutic doses, amphetamine causes emotional and cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control. 
                    It induces physical effects such as improved reaction time, fatigue resistance, and increased muscle strength. 
                    Larger doses of amphetamine may impair cognitive function and induce rapid muscle breakdown. 
                    Addiction is a serious risk with heavy recreational amphetamine use, but is unlikely to occur from long-term medical use at therapeutic doses. 
                    Very high doses can result in psychosis (e.g., delusions and paranoia) which rarely occurs at therapeutic doses even during long-term use. 
                    Recreational doses are generally much larger than prescribed therapeutic doses and carry a far greater risk of serious side effects. 
                    Amphetamine belongs to the phenethylamine class. It is also the parent compound of its own structural class, the substituted amphetamines, which includes prominent substances such as bupropion, cathinone, MDMA, and methamphetamine. 
                    As a member of the phenethylamine class, amphetamine is also chemically related to the naturally occurring trace amine neuromodulators, specifically phenethylamine and N-methylphenethylamine, both of which are produced within the human body. 
                    Phenethylamine is the parent compound of amphetamine, while N-methylphenethylamine is a positional isomer of amphetamine that differs only in the placement of the methyl group.</p>
                <h2>Opiate</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiate" alt="Link to Wikipedia" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/opiate.jpg" alt="Opiate picture"></a>
                <p>
                <strong>Opiato</strong> is a term classically used in pharmacology to mean a drug derived from opium. 
                    Opioid, a more modern term, is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors in the brain (including antagonists). 
                    Opiates are alkaloid compounds naturally found in the opium poppy plant Papaver somniferum. The psychoactive compounds found in the opium plant include morphine, codeine, and thebaine. 
                    Opiates have long been used for a variety of medical conditions with evidence of opiate trade and use for pain relief as early as the eighth century AD. 
                    Opiates are considered drugs with moderate to high abuse potential and are listed on various "Substance-Control Schedules" under the Uniform Controlled Substances Act of the United States of America. 
                    In 2014, between 13 and 20 million people used opiates recreationally (0.3% to 0.4% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). 
                    According to the CDC, from this population, there has been a recorded 47,000 deaths with a total of a half a million deaths from 2000–2014. 
                    In 2016, the World Health Organization reported that 27 million people suffer from opioid abuse disorder. 
                    They also reported that in 2015, 450,000 people died as a result of drug use, with between a third and a half of that number being attributed to opioids.

                <h2>Benzodiazepine</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzodiazepine" alt="Link to Wikipedia" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/benzo.jpg" alt="Benzodiazepine picture"></a>
                <p>
                <strong>Benzodiazepines</strong> (BZD, BDZ, BZs), sometimes called "benzos", are a class of psychoactive drugs whose core chemical structure is the fusion of a benzene ring and a diazepine ring. The first such drug, chlordiazepoxide (Librium), was discovered accidentally by Leo Sternbach in 1955, 
                    and made available in 1960 by Hoffmann–La Roche, which, since 1963, has also marketed the benzodiazepine diazepam (Valium). 
                    In 1977 benzodiazepines were globally the most prescribed medications. 
                    They are in the family of drugs commonly known as minor tranquilizers.
                    Benzodiazepines enhance the effect of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABAA receptor, resulting in sedative, hypnotic (sleep-inducing), anxiolytic (anti-anxiety), anticonvulsant, and muscle relaxant properties. 
                    High doses of many shorter-acting benzodiazepines may also cause anterograde amnesia and dissociation. These properties make benzodiazepines useful in treating anxiety, insomnia, agitation, seizures, muscle spasms, alcohol withdrawal and as a premedication for medical or dental procedures. 
                    Benzodiazepines are categorized as either short, intermediary, or long-acting. 
                    Short- and intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred for the treatment of insomnia; longer-acting benzodiazepines are recommended for the treatment of anxiety.
                    Benzodiazepines are generally viewed as safe and effective for short-term use, which is considered 2-4 weeks, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. 
                    Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. 
                    Long-term use is controversial because of concerns about decreasing effectiveness, physical dependence, benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, and an increased risk of dementia and cancer. In the long-term, stopping benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. 
                    The elderly are at an increased risk of both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults. There is controversy concerning the safety of benzodiazepines in pregnancy. While they are not major teratogens, 
                    uncertainty remains as to whether they cause cleft palate in a small number of babies and whether neurobehavioural effects occur as a result of prenatal exposure; they are known to cause withdrawal symptoms in the newborn.
                    Benzodiazepines can be taken in overdoses and can cause dangerous deep unconsciousness. However, they are less toxic than their predecessors, the barbiturates, and death rarely results when a benzodiazepine is the only drug taken. 
                    When combined with other central nervous system (CNS) depressants such as alcoholic drinks and opioids, the potential for toxicity and fatal overdose increases. 
                    Benzodiazepines are commonly misused and taken in combination with other drugs of abuse.

                <h2>Sex Addiction</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_addiction" alt="Link to Sex Addiction at Wikipedia" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/sex.jpg" alt="Sex Addicts picture"></a>
                <p>Sexual addiction, also known as sex addiction, is a state characterized by compulsive participation or engagement in sexual activity, particularly sexual intercourse, despite negative consequences.
                    Proponents of a diagnostic model for sexual addiction consider it to be one of several sex-related disorders within hypersexual disorder. 
                    The term sexual dependence is also used to refer to people who report being unable to control their sexual urges, behaviors, or thoughts. 
                    Related or synonymous models of pathological sexual behavior include hypersexuality (nymphomania and satyriasis), erotomania, Don Juanism (or Don Juanitaism), and paraphilia-related disorders. 
                    The concept of sexual addiction is contentious. 
                    There is considerable debate among psychiatrists, psychologists, sexologists, and other specialists whether compulsive sexual behavior constitutes an addiction, and therefore its classification and possible diagnosis. 
                    Animal research has established that compulsive sexual behavior arises from the same transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms that mediate drug addiction in laboratory animals; however, 
                    as of 2018, sexual addiction is not a clinical diagnosis in either the DSM or ICD medical classifications of diseases and medical disorders. 
                    Some argue that applying such concepts to normal behaviors such as sex can be problematic, and suggest that applying medical models such as addiction to human sexuality can serve to pathologise normal behavior and cause harm.                
                    The ICD-11 created a new condition classification, compulsive sexual behavior, to cover "a persistent pattern of failure to control intense, repetitive sexual impulses or urges resulting in repetitive sexual behaviour".

                <p><br>
                    None of the official diagnostic classification frameworks list "sexual addiction" as a distinct disorder.
                    <br><br><strong>DSM</strong><br>
                    The American Psychiatric Association (APA) publishes and periodically updates the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a widely recognized compendium of mental health diagnostics.
                    The version published in 1987 (DSM-III-R), referred to "distress about a pattern of repeated sexual conquests or other forms of nonparaphilic sexual addiction, involving a succession of people who exist only as things to be used." 
                    The reference to sexual addiction was subsequently removed. 
                    The DSM-IV-TR, published in 2000 (DSM-IV-TR), did not include sexual addiction as a mental disorder.
                    Some authors suggested that sexual addiction should be re-introduced into the DSM system; however, sexual addiction was rejected for inclusion in the DSM-5, which was published in 2013. 
                    Darrel Regier, vice-chair of the DSM-5 task force, said that "[A]lthough 'hypersexuality' is a proposed new addition...[the phenomenon] was not at the point where we were ready to call it an addiction." 
                    The proposed diagnosis does not make the cut as an official diagnosis due to a lack of research into diagnostic criteria for compulsive sexual behavior, according to the APA.
                    <br><br><strong>ICD</strong><br>
                    The World Health Organization produces the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), which is not limited to mental disorders. 
                    The most recent approved version of that document, ICD-10, includes "excessive sexual drive" as a diagnosis (code F52.7), subdividing it into satyriasis (for males) and nymphomania (for females). However, 
                    the ICD categorizes these diagnoses as compulsive behaviors or impulse control disorders and not addiction. The most recent (yet unapproved) version of that document, 
                    ICD-11, includes "compulsive sexual behavior disorder" as a diagnosis (code 6C72)—it does not use the addiction model.
                    <br><br><strong>CCMD</strong><br>
                    The Chinese Society of Psychiatry produces the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), which is currently in its third edition – the CCMD-3 does not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis.
                    <br><br><strong>Other</strong><br>
                    Some mental health providers have proposed various, but similar, criteria for diagnosing sexual addiction, including Patrick Carnes,[26] and Aviel Goodman. 
                    Carnes authored the first clinical book about sex addiction in 1983, based on his own empirical research. His diagnostic model is still largely utilized by the thousands of certified sex addiction therapists (CSATs) trained by the organization he founded. 
                    No diagnostic proposal for sex addiction has been adopted into any official government diagnostic manual, however, During the update of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual to version 5 (DSM-5), the APA rejected two independent proposals for inclusion.
                    In 2011, the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), the largest medical consensus of physicians dedicated to treating and preventing addiction, redefined addiction as a chronic brain disorder, 
                    which for the first time broadened the definition of addiction from substances to include addictive behaviors and reward-seeking, such as gambling and sex.
                    <br><br><strong>Borderline personality disorder</strong><br>
                    The ICD, DSM and CCMD list promiscuity as a prevalent and problematic symptom for Borderline Personality Disorder. Individuals with this diagnosis sometimes engage in sexual behaviors that can appear out of control, distressing the individual or attracting negative reactions from others. 
                    There is therefore a risk that a person presenting with sex addiction, may in fact be suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder. 
                    This may lead to inappropriate or incomplete treatment.
                    <br><br><strong>Medical reviews and position statements.</strong> <br>
                    In November 2016, the American Association of Sexuality Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT), the official body for sex and relationship therapy in the United States, 
                    issued a position statement on Sex Addiction that states that AASECT, "...does not find sufficient empirical evidence to support the classification of sex addiction or porn addiction as a mental health disorder, 
                    and does not find the sexual addiction training and treatment methods and educational pedagogies to be adequately informed by accurate human sexuality knowledge. 
                    Therefore, it is the position of AASECT that linking problems related to sexual urges, 
                    thoughts or behaviors to a porn/sexual addiction process cannot be advanced by AASECT as a standard of practice for sexuality education delivery, counseling or therapy."
                    In 2017, three new USA sexual health organizations found no support for the idea that sex or adult films were addictive in their position statement.
                    In 16 November 2017 the Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers (ATSA) published a position against sending sex offenders to sex addiction treatment facilities.[36] Those centers argued that "illegal" behaviors were symptoms of sex addiction, which ATSA challenged they had no scientific evidence to support.
                    <br><br><strong>Possible mechanisms</strong><br>
                    Animal research involving rats that exhibit compulsive sexual behavior has identified that this behavior is mediated through the same molecular mechanisms in the brain that mediate drug addiction. 
                    Sexual activity is an intrinsic reward that has been shown to act as a positive reinforcer, strongly activate the reward system, and induce the accumulation of ΔFosB in part of the striatum (specifically, the nucleus accumbens). 
                    Chronic and excessive activation of certain pathways within the reward system and the accumulation of ΔFosB in a specific group of neurons within the nucleus accumbens has been directly implicated in the development of the compulsive behavior that characterizes addiction. 
                    In humans, a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, characterized by drug-induced compulsive engagement in sexual activity or gambling, has also been observed in some individuals taking dopaminergic medications. 
                    Current experimental models of addiction to natural rewards and drug reward demonstrate common alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection. 
                    ΔFosB is the most significant gene transcription factor involved in addiction, since its viral or genetic overexpression in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for most of the neural adaptations and plasticity that occur; it has been implicated in addictions to alcohol, 
                    cannabinoids, cocaine, nicotine, opioids, phenylcyclidine, and substituted amphetamines. 
                    ΔJunD is the transcription factor which directly opposes ΔFosB.
                    Increases in nucleus accumbens ΔJunD expression can reduce or, with a large increase, even block most of the neural alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ΔFosB).
                    <br><br><strong>ΔFosB</strong> also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. 
                    Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state. 
                    Thus, ΔFosB is also the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards as well, and sexual addictions in particular, since ΔFosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward. 
                    Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that psychostimulants and sexual reward possess cross-sensitization effects and act on common biomolecular mechanisms of addiction-related neuroplasticity which are mediated through ΔFosB.

                <p>
                    <strong>Counselling</strong><br>
                    As of 2017, none of the official regulatory bodies for Psychosexual Counselling or Sex and Relationship therapy, have accepted sex addiction as a distinct entity with associated treatment protocols. 
                    Indeed, some practitioners regard sex addiction as a potentially harmful diagnosis and draw parallels with gay conversion therapy. As a result, treatment for sex addiction is more often provided by addiction professionals than psychosexual specialists. 
                    Cognitive behavioral therapy is a common form of behavioral treatment for addictions and maladaptive behaviors in general. Dialectical behavior therapy has been shown to improve treatment outcomes as well. 
                    Certified Sex Addiction Therapists (CSAT) – a group of sexual addiction therapists certified by the International Institute for Trauma and Addiction Professionals – offer specialized behavioral therapy designed specifically for sexual addiction. 
                    Their treatments have yet to be subject to peer-review, so it is unclear if they help or harm patients.
                    <br><br><strong>Support groups</strong><br>
                    This section is transcluded from Template:Sex-related support groups. (edit | history)
                    <br><br><strong>Online support groups</strong><br>
                    NoFap is an online community founded in 2011. It serves as a support group for those who wish to avoid the use of pornography, masturbation, and/or sexual intercourse.
                    <br><br><strong>Further information: NoFap</strong><br>
                    <br><strong>In-person support groups</strong><br>
                    In-person support groups are available in most of the developed world. None yet have any scientific evidence to show whether or not they are helpful, so attendees do so at their own risk.
                    <br><strong>The groups include:</strong><br>
                    <br><strong>Sex Addicts Anonymous</strong>: For those who want to reduce or eliminate their use of pornography, masturbation, and/or unwanted sexual activity.
                    <br><strong>Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous</strong>: Similar to the above.<br>
                    <br><strong>Sexaholics Anonymous</strong>: For those who want to eliminate their use of pornography, masturbation, unwanted sexual activity, and/or sex outside of marriage. Has a stricter definition of sexual sobriety than its competitors.
                    <br><br><strong>SMART Recovery.</strong> <br>
                    In places where none of the above are available, open meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous may be a second-best option. At open AA and NA meetings, non-alcoholics/non-addicts are welcome to observe but not participate. 
                    Support groups may be useful for uninsured or under-insured individuals. (See also: Alcoholics Anonymous § Health-care costs.) They may also be useful as an adjunct to professional treatment. In addition, 
                    they may be useful in places where professional practices are full (i.e. not accepting new patients), scarce, or nonexistent, or where these practices have waiting lists. Finally, they may be useful for patients who are reluctant to spend money on professional treatment.

                    The term "pre-exposure prophylaxis" (PrEP) generally refers to the use of antiviral drugs to help prevent AIDS. PrEP is an optional treatment for people who are HIV-negative, but have a substantial risk of getting an HIV infection.
                    In the US, most insurance plans cover these drugs.

                    According to a systematic review from 2014, observed prevalence rates of sexual addiction/hypersexual disorder range from 3% to 6%. Some studies suggest that sex addicts are disproportionately male, at 80%.

                <p>
                    Sex addiction as a term first emerged in the mid-1970s when various members of Alcoholics Anonymous sought to apply the principles of 12-steps toward sexual recovery from serial infidelity and other 
                    unmanageable compulsive sex behaviors that were similar to the powerlessness and un-manageability they experienced with alcoholism. 
                    Multiple 12-step style self-help groups now exist for people who identify as sex addicts, including Sex Addicts Anonymous, 
                    Sexaholics Anonymous, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous, and Sexual Compulsives Anonymous.

                <p>
                    <br><strong>Controversy</strong><br>
                    "Nonconsensual sexual activity is sexual abuse. 
                    Treatment for sexual addiction generally will not address the factors that lead people to sexually abuse others."— Association for the Treatment of Sexual Abusers. 
                    The controversy surrounding sexual addiction is centered around its identification, through a diagnostic model, in a clinical setting. 
                    As noted in current medical literature reviews, compulsive sexual behavior has been observed in humans; drug-induced compulsive sexual behavior has also been noted clinically in some individuals taking dopaminergic drugs. 
                    0Moreover, some research suggests compulsive engagement in sexual behavior despite negative consequences in animal models. Since current diagnostic models use drug-related concepts as diagnostic criteria for addictions, 
                    these are ill-suited for modelling compulsive behaviors in a clinical setting. Consequently, diagnostic classification systems, such as the DSM, 
                    do not include sexual addiction as a diagnosis because there is currently "insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders". 
                    2014 systematic review on sexual addiction indicated that the "lack of empirical evidence on sexual addiction is the result of the disease's complete absence from versions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders."
                    <br>
                    In a report from 2003, Marty Klein, stated that "the concept of sex addiction provides an excellent example of a model that is both sex-negative and politically disastrous." 
                    Klein singled out a number of features that he considered crucial limitations of the sex addiction model and stated that the diagnostic criteria for sexual addiction are easy to find on the internet. 
                    Drawing on the Sexual Addiction Screening Test, he stated that "the sexual addiction diagnostic criteria make problems of nonproblematic experiences, and as a result pathologize a majority of people."

                <h2>Cannabis</h2>
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" target="_blank"><img class="drugs-pic" src="/img/weed.jpg" alt="Picture of Marijuana"></a>
                <p> 
                    Cannabis, also known as marijuana or weed among other names, is a psychoactive drug from the Cannabis plant used primarily for medical or recreational purposes. 
                    The main psychoactive component of cannabis is tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is one of the 483 known compounds in the plant, including at least 65 other cannabinoids, including cannabidiol (CBD). 
                    Cannabis can be used by smoking, vaporizing, within food, or as an extract. Cannabis has various mental and physical effects, which include euphoria, altered states of mind and sense of time, difficulty concentrating, impaired short-term memory and body movement, relaxation, and an increase in appetite. 
                    Onset of effects is felt within minutes when smoked, and about 30 to 60 minutes when cooked and eaten. 
                    The effects last for two to six hours, depending on the amount used. At high doses, mental effects can include anxiety, delusions (including ideas of reference), hallucinations, panic, paranoia, and psychosis. 
                    There is a strong relation between cannabis use and the risk of psychosis, though the direction of causality is debated. 
                    Physical effects include increased heart rate, difficulty breathing, nausea, and behavioral problems in children whose mothers used cannabis during pregnancy; short-term side effects may also include dry mouth and red eyes. 
                    Long-term adverse effects may include addiction, decreased mental ability in those who started regular use as adolescents, chronic coughing, and susceptibility to respiratory infections.
                    Cannabis is mostly used recreationally or as a medicinal drug, although it may also be used for spiritual purposes. In 2013, between 128 and 232 million people used cannabis (2.7% to 4.9% of the global population between the ages of 15 and 65). 
                    It is the most commonly used illegal drug in the world, though it is also legal in some jurisdictions, with the highest use among adults (as of 2018) in Zambia, the United States, Canada, and Nigeria. 
                    While cannabis plants have been grown since at least the 3rd millennium BCE, evidence suggests that it was being smoked for psychoactive effects at least 2,500 
                    years ago in the Pamir Mountains; the earliest evidence found at a cemetery in what is today western China close to the tripoint with Tajikistan and Afghanistan. 
                    Since the early 20th century, cannabis has been subject to legal restrictions. The possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis is illegal in most countries of the world. 
                    In 2013, Uruguay became the first country to legalize recreational use of cannabis. Other countries to do so are Canada, Georgia, and South Africa, along with 11 states and the District of Columbia in the United States (though the drug remains federally illegal). 
                    Medical use of cannabis, requiring the approval of a physician, has been legalized in many countries.

                    Medical cannabis, or medical marijuana, can refer to the use of cannabis and its cannabinoids to treat disease or improve symptoms; however, there is no single agreed-upon definition. 
                    The rigorous scientific study of cannabis as a medicine has been hampered by production restrictions and by the fact that it is classified as an illegal drug by many governments. 
                    There is limited evidence suggesting cannabis can be used to reduce nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy, to improve appetite in people with HIV/AIDS, or to treat chronic pain and muscle spasms. 
                    Its use for other medical applications is insufficient for drawing conclusions about safety or efficacy.
                    Short-term use increases the risk of both minor and major adverse effects. 
                    Common side effects include dizziness, feeling tired and vomiting. 
                    The long-term effects of cannabis are not clear. There are concerns surrounding memory and cognition problems, risk of addiction, risk of schizophrenia in young people, and the risk of children taking it by accident.

                    EFFECTS OF CANNABIS<br>
                    Cannabis has psychoactive and physiological effects when consumed. 
                    The immediate desired effects from consuming cannabis include relaxation and euphoria (the "high" or "stoned" feeling), a general alteration of conscious perception, increased awareness of sensation, increased libido[25] and distortions in the perception of time and space. At higher doses, effects can include altered body image, auditory and/or visual illusions, 
                    pseudohallucinations and ataxia from selective impairment of polysynaptic reflexes.[citation needed] In some cases, cannabis can lead to dissociative states such as depersonalization and derealization. 
                    Some immediate undesired side effects include a decrease in short-term memory, dry mouth, impaired motor skills and reddening of the eyes. 
                    Aside from a subjective change in perception and mood, the most common short-term physical and neurological effects include increased heart rate, increased appetite and consumption of food, lowered blood pressure, impairment of short-term and working memory,[55][56] psychomotor coordination, and concentration. 
                    Some users may experience an episode of acute psychosis, which usually abates after six hours, but in rare instances, heavy users may find the symptoms continuing for many days. 
                    A reduced quality of life is associated with heavy cannabis use, although the relationship is inconsistent and weaker than for tobacco and other substances. 
                    The direction of cause and effect, however, is unclear.[58]

                    <strong>Spiritual</strong>
                    <br>
                    Cannabis has held sacred status in several religions and has served as an entheogen – a chemical substance used in religious, shamanic, or spiritual contexts – in the Indian subcontinent since the Vedic period dating back to approximately 1500 BCE, but perhaps as far back as 2000 BCE. 
                    There are several references in Greek mythology to a powerful drug that eliminated anguish and sorrow. 
                    Herodotus wrote about early ceremonial practices by the Scythians, thought to have occurred from the 5th to 2nd century BCE. In modern culture, the spiritual use of cannabis has been spread by the disciples of the Rastafari movement who use cannabis as a sacrament and as an aid to meditation. 
                    The earliest known reports regarding the sacred status of cannabis in the Indian subcontinent come from the Atharva Veda, estimated to have been composed sometime around 1400 BCE.

                    <strong>Available forms</strong>
                    <br>
                    Cannabis is consumed in many different ways, all of which involve heating to decarboxylate THCA in the plant into THC. 
                    Smoking, which typically involves burning and inhaling vaporized cannabinoids ("smoke") from small pipes, bongs (portable versions of hookahs with a water chamber), paper-wrapped joints or tobacco-leaf-wrapped blunts, and other items.[63]
                    Vaporizer, which heats any form of cannabis to 165–190 °C (329–374 °F),[64] causing the active ingredients to evaporate into vapor without burning the plant material (the boiling point of THC is 157 °C (315 °F) at atmospheric pressure).
                    Cannabis tea, which contains relatively small concentrations of THC because THC is an oil (lipophilic) and is only slightly water-soluble (with a solubility of 2.8 mg per liter). 
                    Cannabis tea is made by first adding a saturated fat to hot water (e.g. cream or any milk except skim) with a small amount of cannabis.
                    Edibles, where cannabis is added as an ingredient to one of a variety of foods, including butter and baked goods. In India it is commonly made into a beverage, bhang.
                    Capsules, typically containing cannabis oil, and other dietary supplement products, for which some 220 were approved in Canada in 2018.

                    <h3>Adverse effects</h3>
                <p>    
                    Addiction experts in psychiatry, chemistry, pharmacology, forensic science, epidemiology, and the police and legal services engaged in delphic analysis regarding 20 popular recreational drugs. 
                    Cannabis was ranked 11th in dependence, 17th in physical harm, and 10th in social harm.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Short term</strong> 
                    <br>
                    Acute effects may include anxiety and panic, impaired attention and memory, an increased risk of psychotic symptoms,[b] the inability to think clearly, and an increased risk of accidents. 
                    Cannabis impairs a person's driving ability, and THC was the illicit drug most frequently found in the blood of drivers who have been involved in vehicle crashes. 
                    Those with THC in their system are from three to seven times more likely to be the cause of the accident than those who had not used either cannabis or alcohol, although its role is not necessarily causal because THC stays in the bloodstream for days to weeks after intoxication. 
                    According to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, there were 455,000 emergency room visits associated with cannabis use in 2011. These statistics include visits in which the patient was treated for a condition induced by or related to recent cannabis use. 
                    The drug use must be "implicated" in the emergency department visit, but does not need to be the direct cause of the visit. 
                    Most of the illicit drug emergency room visits involved multiple drugs.[78] In 129,000 cases, cannabis was the only implicated drug. 
                    The short term effects of cannabis can be altered if it has been laced with opioid drugs such as heroin or fentanyl.[81] The added drugs are meant to enhance the psychoactive properties, add to its weight, and increase profitability, despite the increased danger of overdose.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Long term</strong>
                    <br>
                    Heavy, long-term exposure to marijuana may have biologically based physical, mental, behavioral and social health consequences and may be "associated with diseases of the liver (particularly with co-existing hepatitis C), lungs, heart, and vasculature".[85] Mothers who used marijuana during pregnancy have children with more depression, hyperactivity, and inattention. 
                    It is recommended that cannabis use be stopped before and during pregnancy as it can result in negative outcomes for both the mother and baby. 
                    However, maternal use of marijuana during pregnancy does not appear to be associated with low birth weight or early delivery after controlling for tobacco use and other confounding factors. 
                    A 2014 review found that while cannabis use may be less harmful than alcohol use, the recommendation to substitute it for problematic drinking was premature without further study. 
                    Various surveys conducted between 2015 and 2019 found that many users of cannabis substitute it for prescription drugs (including opioids), alcohol, and tobacco; most of those who used it in place of alcohol or tobacco either reduced or stopped their intake of the latter substances. 
                    A limited number of studies have examined the effects of cannabis smoking on the respiratory system. 
                    Chronic heavy marijuana smoking is associated with coughing, production of sputum, wheezing, and other symptoms of chronic bronchitis. 
                    The available evidence does not support a causal relationship between cannabis use and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
                    Short-term use of cannabis is associated with bronchodilation.[94] Other side effects of cannabis use include cannabinoid hyperemesis syndrome (CHS). 
                    Cannabis smoke contains thousands of organic and inorganic chemical compounds. This tar is chemically similar to that found in tobacco smoke, and over fifty known carcinogens have been identified in cannabis smoke, including; nitrosamines, reactive aldehydes, and polycylic hydrocarbons, including benz[a]pyrene. 
                    Cannabis smoke is also inhaled more deeply than tobacco smoke.[99] As of 2015, there is no consensus regarding whether cannabis smoking is associated with an increased risk of cancer. 
                    Light and moderate use of cannabis is not believed to increase risk of lung or upper airway cancer. 
                    Evidence for causing these cancers is mixed concerning heavy, long-term use. In general there are far lower risks of pulmonary complications for regular cannabis smokers when compared with those of tobacco. 
                    A 2015 review found an association between cannabis use and the development of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), particularly non-seminoma TGCTs.[102] Another 2015 meta-analysis found no association between lifetime cannabis use and risk of head or neck cancer. 
                    Combustion products are not present when using a vaporizer, consuming THC in pill form, or consuming cannabis foods. 
                    There is concern that cannabis may contribute to cardiovascular disease,[105] but as of 2018, evidence of this relationship was unclear.[106] Research in these events is complicated because cannabis is often used in conjunction with tobacco, and drugs such as alcohol and cocaine. 
                    Smoking cannabis has also been shown to increase the risk of myocardial infarction by 4.8 times for the 60 minutes after consumption.

                    <strong>Neuroimaging</strong>
                    <br>
                    Although global abnormalities in white matter and grey matter are not associated with cannabis abuse, reduced hippocampal volume is consistently found. 
                    Amygdala abnormalities are sometimes reported, although findings are inconsistent. 
                    Cannabis use is associated with increased recruitment of task-related areas, such as the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is thought to reflect compensatory activity due to reduced processing efficiency. 
                    Cannabis use is also associated with downregulation of CB1 receptors. The magnitude of down regulation is associated with cumulative cannabis exposure, and is reversed after one month of abstinence. 
                    There is limited evidence that chronic cannabis use can reduce levels of glutamate metabolites in the human brain.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Cognition</strong>
                    <br>
                    A 2015 meta analysis found that, although a longer period of abstinence was associated with smaller magnitudes of impairment, both retrospective and prospective memory were impaired in cannabis users. 
                    The authors concluded that some, but not all, of the deficits associated with cannabis use were reversible. 
                    A 2012 meta analysis found that deficits in most domains of cognition persisted beyond the acute period of intoxication, but was not evident in studies where subjects were abstinent for more than 25 days. 
                    Few high quality studies have been performed on the long-term effects of cannabis on cognition, and the results were generally inconsistent. 
                    Furthermore, effect sizes of significant findings were generally small. 
                    One review concluded that, although most cognitive faculties were unimpaired by cannabis use, residual deficits occurred in executive functions. 
                    Impairments in executive functioning are most consistently found in older populations, which may reflect heavier cannabis exposure, or developmental effects associated with adolescent cannabis use. 
                    One review found three prospective cohort studies that examined the relationship between self reported cannabis use and intelligence quotient (IQ). 
                    The study following the largest number of heavy cannabis users reported that IQ declined between ages 7–13 and age 38. 
                    Poorer school performance and increased incidence of leaving school early were both associated with cannabis use, although a causal relationship was not established. 
                    Cannabis users demonstrated increased activity in task-related brain regions, consistent with reduced processing efficiency.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Psychiatric</strong>
                    <br>
                    At an epidemiological level, a dose–response relationship exists between cannabis use and increased risk of psychosis and earlier onset of psychosis. 
                    Although the epidemiological association is robust, evidence to prove a causal relationship is lacking. 
                    But a biological causal pathway is plausible, especially if there is a genetic predisposition to mental illness, in which case cannabis may be a trigger. 
                    It is not clear whether cannabis use affects the rate of suicide. 
                    Cannabis may also increase the risk of depression, but insufficient research has been performed to draw a conclusion. 
                    Cannabis use is associated with increased risk of anxiety disorders, although causality has not been established. 
                    A February 2019 review found that cannabis use during adolescence was associated with an increased risk of developing depression and suicidal behavior later in life, while finding no effect on anxiety.
                    
                    <strong>Reinforcement disorders</strong>
                    About 9% of those who experiment with marijuana eventually become dependent according to DSM-IV (1994) criteria. 
                    A 2013 review estimates daily use is associated with a 10–20% rate of dependence. 
                    The highest risk of cannabis dependence is found in those with a history of poor academic achievement, deviant behavior in childhood and adolescence, rebelliousness, poor parental relationships, 
                    or a parental history of drug and alcohol problems. Of daily users, about 50% experience withdrawal upon cessation of use (i.e. are dependent), characterized by sleep problems, irritability, dysphoria, and craving. 
                    Cannabis withdrawal is less severe than withdrawal from alcohol. 
                    According to DSM-V criteria, 9% of those who are exposed to cannabis develop cannabis use disorder, compared to 20% for cocaine, 23% for alcohol and 68% for nicotine. 
                    Cannabis abuse disorder in the DSM-V involves a combination of DSM-IV criteria for cannabis abuse and dependence, plus the addition of craving, minus the criterion related to legal troubles.

                    <h3>Overdose</h3>
                <p>    
                    THC, the principal psychoactive constituent of the cannabis plant, has low toxicity. 
                    The dose of THC needed to kill 50% of tested rodents is extremely high. Cannabis has not been reported to cause fatal overdose in humans.
                </p>    
                    <h3>Pharmacology</h3>
                <p> 
                    The high lipid-solubility of cannabinoids results in their persisting in the body for long periods of time. 
                    Even after a single administration of THC, detectable levels of THC can be found in the body for weeks or longer (depending on the amount administered and the sensitivity of the assessment method). 
                    Investigators have suggested that this is an important factor in marijuana's effects, perhaps because cannabinoids may accumulate in the body, particularly in the lipid membranes of neurons. 
                    Researchers confirmed that THC exerts its most prominent effects via its actions on two types of cannabinoid receptors, the CB1 receptor and the CB2 receptor, both of which are G protein-coupled receptors. 
                    The CB1 receptor is found primarily in the brain as well as in some peripheral tissues, and the CB2 receptor is found primarily in peripheral tissues, but is also expressed in neuroglial cells. 
                    THC appears to alter mood and cognition through its agonist actions on the CB1 receptors, which inhibit a secondary messenger system (adenylate cyclase) in a dose-dependent manner.
                    Via CB1 receptor activation, THC indirectly increases dopamine release and produces psychotropic effects. 
                    CBD also acts as an allosteric modulator of the μ- and δ-opioid receptors. 
                    THC also potentiates the effects of the glycine receptors.[142] It is unknown if or how these actions contribute to the effects of cannabis.
                </p>
                    <h3>Chemistry</h3>
                <p>
                    THC and its major (inactive) metabolite, THC-COOH, can be measured in blood, urine, hair, oral fluid or sweat using chromatographic techniques as part of a drug use testing program or a forensic investigation of a traffic or other criminal offense. 
                    The concentrations obtained from such analyses can often be helpful in distinguishing active use from passive exposure, elapsed time since use, and extent or duration of use. 
                    These tests cannot, however, distinguish authorized cannabis smoking for medical purposes from unauthorized recreational smoking. 
                    Commercial cannabinoid immunoassays, often employed as the initial screening method when testing physiological specimens for marijuana presence, have different degrees of cross-reactivity with THC and its metabolites. 
                    Urine contains predominantly THC-COOH, while hair, oral fluid and sweat contain primarily THC.[57] Blood may contain both substances, with the relative amounts dependent on the recency and extent of usage. 
                    The Duquenois–Levine test is commonly used as a screening test in the field, but it cannot definitively confirm the presence of cannabis, as a large range of substances have been shown to give false positives. 
                    Researchers at John Jay College of Criminal Justice reported that dietary zinc supplements can mask the presence of THC and other drugs in urine. 
                    However, a 2013 study conducted by researchers at the University of Utah School of Medicine refute the possibility of self-administered zinc producing false-negative urine drug tests.

                    <h3>Varieties and strains</h3>
                <p>
                    <strong>Types of cannabis</strong>
                    CBD is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, which is under laboratory research to determine if it has an anxiolytic effect. 
                    It is often claimed that sativa strains provide a more stimulating psychoactive high while indica strains are more sedating with a body high. 
                    However, this is disputed by researchers.
                    
                    <strong>Psychoactive ingredients.</strong> 
                    According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), "the amount of THC present in a cannabis sample is generally used as a measure of cannabis potency." 
                    The three main forms of cannabis products are the flower/fruit, resin (hashish), and oil (hash oil). The UNODC states that cannabis often contains 5% THC content, resin "can contain up to 20% THC content", and that "Cannabis oil may contain more than 60% THC content."
                    A 2012 review found that the THC content in marijuana had increased worldwide from 1970 to 2009. 
                    It is unclear, however, whether the increase in THC content has caused people to consume more THC or if users adjust based on the potency of the cannabis. 
                    It is likely that the higher THC content allows people to ingest less tar. At the same time, CBD levels in seized samples have lowered, in part because of the desire to produce higher THC levels and because more illegal growers cultivate indoors using artificial lights. 
                    This helps avoid detection but reduces the CBD production of the plant.
                    Australia's National Cannabis Prevention and Information Centre (NCPIC) states that the buds (infructescences) of the female cannabis plant contain the highest concentration of THC, followed by the leaves. The stalks and seeds have "much lower THC levels". 
                    The UN states that the leaves can contain ten times less THC than the buds, and the stalks one hundred times less THC.
                    After revisions to cannabis scheduling in the UK, the government moved cannabis back from a class C to a class B drug. 
                    A purported reason was the appearance of high potency cannabis. They believe skunk accounts for between 70 and 80% of samples seized by police (despite the fact that skunk can sometimes be incorrectly mistaken for all types of herbal cannabis). 
                    Extracts such as hashish and hash oil typically contain more THC than high potency cannabis infructescences.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Twelve-step methods have been adapted to address a wide range of alcoholism, substance-abuse and dependency problems. 
                    Over 200 self-help organizations—often known as fellowships—with a worldwide membership of millions—now employ twelve-step principles for recovery. 
                    Narcotics Anonymous was formed by addicts who did not relate to the specifics of alcohol dependency.
                    Demographic preferences related to the addicts' drug of choice has led to the creation of Cocaine Anonymous, Crystal Meth Anonymous and Marijuana Anonymous. 
                    Behavioral issues such as compulsion for, and/or addiction to, gambling, crime, food, sex, hoarding, getting into debt and work are addressed in fellowships such as Gamblers Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous.
                    Auxiliary groups such as Al-Anon and Nar-Anon, for friends and family members of alcoholics and addicts, respectively, are part of a response to treating addiction as a disease that is enabled by family systems. Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACA or ACOA) addresses the effects of growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family. 
                    Co-Dependents Anonymous (CoDA) addresses compulsions related to relationships, referred to as codependency.

                    Over 200 self-help organizations—often known as fellowships—with a worldwide membership of millions—now employ twelve-step principles for recovery. 
                    Narcotics Anonymous was formed by addicts who did not relate to the specifics of alcohol dependency.
                    Demographic preferences related to the addicts' drug of choice has led to the creation of Cocaine Anonymous, Crystal Meth Anonymous and Marijuana Anonymous. 
                    Behavioral issues such as compulsion for, and/or addiction to, gambling, crime, food, sex, hoarding, getting into debt and work are addressed in fellowships such as Gamblers Anonymous, Overeaters Anonymous, Sexaholics Anonymous and Debtors Anonymous.
                    Auxiliary groups such as Al-Anon and Nar-Anon, for friends and family members of alcoholics and addicts, respectively, are part of a response to treating addiction as a disease that is enabled by family systems. Adult Children of Alcoholics (ACA or ACOA) addresses the effects of growing up in an alcoholic or otherwise dysfunctional family. 
                    Co-Dependents Anonymous (CoDA) addresses compulsions related to relationships, referred to as codependency.

                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), the first twelve-step fellowship, was founded in 1935 by Bill Wilson and Dr. Robert Holbrook Smith, known to AA members as "Bill W." and "Dr. Bob", in Akron, Ohio. In 1946 they formally established the twelve traditions to help deal with the issues of how various groups could relate and function as membership grew.
                   The practice of remaining anonymous (using only one's first names) when interacting with the general public was published in the first edition of the AA Big Book.
                   As AA chapters were increasing in number during the 1930s and 1940s, the guiding principles were gradually defined as the Twelve Traditions. 
                   A singleness of purpose emerged as Tradition Five: "Each group has but one primary purpose—to carry its message to the alcoholic who still suffers". Consequently, drug addicts who do not suffer from the specifics of alcoholism involved in AA hoping for recovery technically are not welcome in "closed" meetings unless they have a desire to stop drinking alcohol. 
                   The principles of AA have been used to form many numbers of other fellowships specifically designed for those recovering from various pathologies; each emphasizes recovery from the specific malady which brought the sufferer into the fellowship.

                <h3>Process</h3>
                <p>In the twelve-step program, the human structure is symbolically represented in three dimensions: physical, mental, and spiritual. 
                   The problems the groups deal with are understood to manifest themselves in each dimension. For addicts and alcoholics, the physical dimension is best described by the allergy-like bodily reaction resulting in the compulsion to continue using substances after the initial use. 
                   The statement in the First Step that the individual is "powerless" over the substance-abuse related behavior at issue refers to the lack of control over this compulsion, which persists despite any negative consequences that may be endured as a result.
                   The mental obsession is described as the cognitive processes that cause the individual to repeat the compulsive behavior after some period of abstinence, either knowing that the result will be an inability to stop or operating under the delusion that the result will be different. 
                   The description in the First Step of the life of the alcoholic or addict as "unmanageable" refers to the lack of choice that the mind of the addict or alcoholic affords concerning whether to drink or use again. 
                   The illness of the spiritual dimension, or "spiritual malady," is considered in all twelve-step groups to be self-centeredness. 
                   The process of working the steps is intended to replace self-centeredness with a growing moral consciousness and a willingness for self-sacrifice and unselfish constructive action. 
                   In twelve-step groups, this is known as a "spiritual awakening." This should not be confused with abreaction, which produces dramatic, but temporary, changes, As a rule, in twelve-step fellowships, spiritual awakening is occurs slowly over a period of time, although there are exceptions where members experience a sudden spiritual awakening.
                   In accordance with the First Step, twelve-step groups emphasize self-admission by members of the problem they are recovering from. It is in this spirit that members often identify themselves along with an admission of their problem, often as "Hi, I’m [first name only], and I’m an alcoholic".

                <h3>Criticism</h3>
                <p>The criticisms of twelve-step groups are as varied as the pathologies they address. People have attended twelve-step meetings, only to find success eluded them. 
                    Their varied success rate and the belief in a Higher Power suggested in them, are common criticisms of their universal applicability and efficacy.
